# Shattered Kingdom: Text-Based Adventure Game

Welcome to **Shattered Kingdom**, a text-based RPG where you take on the role of a hero in the fractured world of **Elyndor**. Your mission is to recover the five pieces of the legendary **Shattered Crown** and unite the kingdom before the dark sorcerer **Malakar** plunges it into chaos.

## Features

-   **Classes**: Choose between **Warrior**, **Mage**, or **Rogue**, each with unique abilities and playstyles.
-   **Exploration**: Journey through the **Frostbound Peaks**, **Sunken Ruins**, **Forbidden Forest**, **Ashen Wastes**, and **Abyssal Tower**.
-   **Combat**: Engage in turn-based battles with mythical creatures and rival warlords.
-   **Quests and Choices**: Complete side quests, make moral decisions, and shape the future of Elyndor through your actions.
-   **Multiple Endings**: Your choices throughout the game determine the fate of the kingdom.

## Inspiration

The world of Elyndor and the plot of **Shattered Kingdom** are inspired by classic RPG mechanics and fantasy tropes found in games like _The Elder Scrolls_ series, _The Legend of Zelda_, and traditional _Dungeons & Dragons_ campaigns. These inspirations helped shape the game's atmosphere and mechanics, but the story and characters are entirely original.

## Technologies Used

-   **C++**: The game is written in C++ to take advantage of object-oriented programming and memory management.
-   **STL**: Utilizes the Standard Template Library for efficient handling of player inventory, quests, and game logic.
-   **File I/O**: Supports saving and loading game progress using file streams.
-   **Smart Pointers**: Implements modern C++ techniques like smart pointers to manage memory and avoid leaks.
