Its fields and meadows flourish under a tranquil sunrise, but every path holds whispers of the kingdom's shattered past. The Shattered Crown pieces remain hidden across these dangerous lands, and you know you must seek them out.\n\nYet even here, in the valley's peace, you feel the pull of fate and the darkness creeping from distant borders. Though a humble adventurer, you can choose to continue your quiet life or heed the call to unite Elyndor once more.",
